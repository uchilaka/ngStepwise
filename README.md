# This Is ngStepwise
This plugin is the designed to:
- Provide an easy to setup wizard progress bar i.e. the "Here's where you are in this process" and "here's how much more stuff you need to do" type views on websites 
- Requires AngularJS (it's an AngularJS directive)
- Requires Bootstrap for the tooltip functionality 

## Limitations
If you have more than 6 or so steps in your workflow, you probably need to do something differently on your UI than trying to cram all of them into a slider bar. 

This tool is still super new. As I build on it, I'll be looking to add more functionality and handle more than a few steps

## Preview

Here's what a stepwise progress bar looks like:
